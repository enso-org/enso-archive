# Enso Developer Documentation
This folder contains the documentation for the implementation of the Enso
programming language. The documentation is broken up by subject, within the
below-listed categories, and each subject combines information about the
design, specification, and implementation of the feature to which it pertains.

It is broken up into categories as follows:

- [**The Enso Philosophy:**](./enso-philosophy.md) Information on the design
  philosophy behind Enso, and why we build things in the way we do.
- [**Distribution:**](./distirbution) Information on how we distribute Enso to
  our users, and how Enso packages themselves work.
