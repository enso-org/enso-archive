# Enso Documentation
This folder contains the documentation for the implementation of the Enso
programming language. The documentation is generally broken up into three
categories: design, specification, and implementation.

- **Design:** Documents in this category deal with the reasoning behind the 
  language specification.
- **Specification:** The language specification.
- **Implementation:** Details of how the specification is _implemented_ in the
  compiler and the runtime.

It is broken up into categories as follows:

- [**The Enso Philosophy:**](./enso-philosophy.md): Information on the design
  philosophy behind Enso, and why we build things in the way we do.
- [**Distribution:**](./distirbution): Information on how we distribute Enso to
  our users, and how Enso packages themselves work.
