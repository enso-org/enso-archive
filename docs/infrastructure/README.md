# Infrastructure
The Enso runtime runs on the GraalVM which is a version of JVM. It currently
uses JDK 8, but there are plans to migrate to JDK 11. This folder contains all
documentation pertaining to the used infrastructure, which is broken up as
follows:

- [**sbt:**](./sbt.md) The build tools that are used for building the project.
- [**Java 11:**](./java11.md) Current status of migration to Java 11.
